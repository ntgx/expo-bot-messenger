![ICT Expo Messenger Bot](screenshots/messenger_code.png)

This is the official messenger bot for the first international ICT Expo in Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ (June 28 - July 02). Over 200,000 are expected to attend!

You can play with the bot [here](https://m.me/ictexpoethiopia) or by scanning the code above

## Progress
- [x] Send Exhibitors, schedule, speakers, events, sponsors, floor plan
- [x] Conversational form to register users for the lotto
- [x] Use apiai to do NLP (smalltalk with the user and accepts commands, questions)
- [ ] Set reminder feature for events and daily schedule
- [ ] Collect website, tel and logo of all exhibitors, logos for sponsors & urls for learn more on the speaker cards
- [ ] Show the github contributors within the bot
- [ ] After expo ends make it generic enough so anyone can just replace the JSON data and have a good starting point for a new expo, conference or exhibition bot

## Building and Deploying
Run `$ yarn` to install the dependencies and set these environment variables:

- **PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN**
- **VERIFY_TOKEN**
- **APP_SECRET**
- **PORT**
- **EXPO_MONGO_URI** - Setup Mongo locally or use a hosted service like [mlab](https://mlab.com) and provide the connection URI
- **EXPO_API_AI_TOKEN** - Sign up on [apiai](https://api.ai) to get your token

Check the [Messenger Platform Quick Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start) for how to get the first three and to setup your webhook.

For your webhook URL you can deploy the app to heroku or if you want to run the server locally you can use [ngork](https://ngrok.com).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome...even during the expo! There will be space there to hack on the bots[1] together & to show anyone interested the basics. Contributors will be shown within the bot.

[1] There's also a [Telegram Bot](https://github.com/ntgx/expo-bot-telegram)
